// regex explanation (I may be wrong, regex is fun...):
//
// .{1,32}       # 1 up to 32 of any character
// (?<=          # look behind (basically previous must end in this regex):
//   \s|\S-      # either a whitespace char, a non-whitespace char followed by a hypen
// )
//
// we then replace matches in the string with $0\n, meaning whatever was matched then a newline
//
// alternative: (.{1,32})(?:\s+|(?:<=\S-)) -> $1\n
// same but without the trailing whitespace being counted as part of the 32 and also then not included in output, makes
// for some more 'full' lines of 32 characters and a harder to understand regex
